The everyday workflow
---------------------

The normal everyday workflow in git/github is fairly simple and soon enough should be ingrained in your brain.

Teamwork via git
----------------

One of the possible git distributed workflows is the [Integration Manager Workflow](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#Integration-Manager-Workflow).

In this part, we will cover this type of workflow using forks.

###Exercise

1. Fork this repo. 

  ![click it](img/forkbutton.jpg "fork it!")

2. Clone your fork to your computer

  a. Copy the address of the repo (your fork) 

  ![click on](img/cloneit.jpg)
  
  b. Go to your terminal or git and write (in the folder where you want your repo)
  
    ```git
    git clone http_of_your_fork
    ```
3. Do 4 and 5 in your local computer.
4. Add a folder in your fork with your name inside the subdirectory *excercises*
5. Add a .txt file with "Hello world! -your name- is commiting to working now with github!"
6. Go to your terminal and follow your daily workflow

  ```git
  git pull
  git add .
  git status
  git commit -m "I commit to github"
  git push
  ```

7. See the changes in your github!

Basic commands
--------------

```git
git status
```
Status allows you to view what you have in your local machine, what is in the cloud, etc.

```git
git pull
```

Pulling is your way to connect to github. 

Keeping your fork update
------------------------

```
  > git remote -v
```
This command should show only `origin` pointing to your fork of this tutorial. A `remote` is a relate repository (with 
shared history) in which you can do `pull` or `push` as you do with your original.

Lets add the remote of this tutorial.

```
  > git remote add animalito https://github.com/animalito/github_tutorial.git
```

Execute again `git remote -v` and you will see `2` repos.

To make `pull` to the changes that are in `remote` `animalito` just do

```
  > git pull animalito master
```

Note that to `pull` from your `fork`, you still need only do `git pull`.

Si todo sale bien, ahora pueden hacer `push` a su `fork`. Esto mantendr√° los cambios sincronizados.
