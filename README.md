Mini tutorial enphasizing uses in social sciences.

Installation
------------

###Windows
The *first* and most important thing you have to ask yourself is: why, why, why am I **still in windows**? 

The *second* thing to ask yourself is why do I keep **doing this to myself**?

If you choose not to heed this advice, [here's](http://msysgit.github.io/) what you gotta do to have git on windows.

###Linux

####Fedora 
```bash
$ yum install git-core
```

####Debian
```bash
$ apt-get install git
```

###Mac
Hahaha you spent a LOT of money! Don't be so *fresa*
Did you see how **easy** it was for linux users? There is two ways for you:

1. [Via the git installer](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer)
2. With [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org) installed:

```bash
$ sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb
```
